\chapter{Sprint Review}\label{chap:sprint4_end}
Overall this sprint went well. We did get a bit behind on during the sprint, but we prioritized tasks related to user stories, and therefore we still managed to complete all of our user stories. The tasks which were postponed are related to finishing the parts of the report which are not directly related to the work we did this sprint e.g. introduction and evaluation.

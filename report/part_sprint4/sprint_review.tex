\chapter{Sprint Review}\label{chap:sprint4_end}
Overall this sprint went well. We did not accomplish all of our tasks, but that was expected as we had more work than we time. We prioritized tasks related to user stories, and therefore we still managed to complete all of our user stories. The tasks which were postponed are related to finishing the parts of the report which are not directly related to the work we did this sprint e.g. introduction and evaluation. We had a server breakdown 14\textsuperscript{th} of May and it was restored on the 18\textsuperscript{th} of May to the state it was in the morning of the 13\textsuperscript{th} of May. So the server was down two days and we lost an additional days work. There was no loss of code, because of the way Git works, the developers still had the code on their machines. The changes to the configuration of Jenkins during that period was lost however. We did not make many changes, to Jenkins during this period so it was quickly restored once the server was up again. We however recommend that there be made separate backups of the configuration to somewhere other than the server to prevent issues in the future.

\chapter{Sprint Review}\label{chap:sprint4_end}
 We accomplished all the selected tasks. The report tasks which were postponed are related to finishing the parts of the report which are not directly related to the work we did this sprint. As written, these reports tasks will be completed in the week between sprint end and project deadline.

\begin{chapterorganization}
    \item in \sectionref{sec:s4_goals} we evaluate how the sprint went and wether we reached our goals on a group level.
    \item in \sectionref{sec:s4_multiprj_review} we evaluate how the sprint went on the multi-project level.

\section{Sprint Goals}\label{sec:s4_goals}
\begin{description}
    \item[Prioritizing Libraries (1)] We have changed the build queue in Jenkins to be a prioritized queue, which uses scheduling that favors libraries over apps, but still prevents starvation.
    \item[Run monkey tests on debug builds (2)] We have changed our monkey tests scripts such that the tests now are performed on debug builds of the apps instead of release builds.
    \item[Easy download and install (3)] We have made a Powershell and a Bash script which downloads the newest build of every app from the FTP server and install them on the a connected tablet in an automated manner without additional software on one's device.
    \item[Document Jenkins configuration (4)] We have created a document which details how the jobs are configured as well as which files are important, what they are, and where they are. Additionally the document contains details about the authentication system and recommendations to that. We believe this guide is useful for the future developers.
    \item[Screenshot of monkey test (5)] We have a user story which required some other changes to how the monkey tests are run. When we made those changes it did not require that much effort to also make the monkey test capture screenshots. Now a screenshot is saved from each device after a monkey test has finished, including if it crashed.
    \item[Decrease build times on Jenkins (6)] We have improved the build times on Jenkins. Now we have a pool of tablets available for testing, such that we do not have to start a emulator. This saves time every build. We have decreased the build time by approximately \SI{30}{\percent}.

\section{Multi-Project Sprint Review}\label{sec:s4_multiprj_review}
The multi-project sprint review went well\kimnote{delete this sentence}. The sprint review was held on the 20\textsuperscript{th} of May. There was some stress leading up to the sprint review because of server troubles. We had a server breakdown on the 14\textsuperscript{th} of May and it was restored on the 18\textsuperscript{th} of May to the state it was in the morning of the 13\textsuperscript{th} of May. The server was down two work days and we lost an additional day's work. There was no loss of code, because of the decentralized way Git works --- the developers still had the code locally. The changes \kimnote{+made} to the configuration of Jenkins during that period was lost, however\kimnote{It is not often that I see however in the end of a sentence, I would but it in the front of the sentence.}. We did not make many changes, so it was quickly restored once the server was up again. We however recommend to create separate backups of the configuration to somewhere other than the server to prevent such an issue in the future. \kimnote{This is a very interesting topic and we might discuss at the exam. Consider adding an analysis of why such a breakdown could happen and why you you where not prepared for such a scenario.}

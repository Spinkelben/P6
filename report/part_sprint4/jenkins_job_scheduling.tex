\begin{description}
  \item[Absolute] The queue is strictly ordered by priority. The highest priority job is greedily selected every time a new job is to be executed.
  \item[Fair Queuing] The first job from each priority group is executed in round-robin scheduling. This way, each priority get equal execution time.
  \item[Weighted Fair Queuing]

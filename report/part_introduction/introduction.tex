\chapter{Introduction}
Every year, children and young adults are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) \cite{autism_diagnosis_adults,autism_diagnosis_children}. There are no known cures, and treatment focuses on improving independence and quality of life \cite{Myers01112007}. This project is a collaboration between the Software students on \nth{6} semester at Aalborg University and several institutions, located in Aalborg Municipality, which offer care to children or adults who suffer from ASDs. The goal of the project is to ease the workload of the caregivers at these institutions and help persons with ASDs become more independent. Currently, the caregivers have a selection of tools and methods which they use in the treatment of the ASDs. Some of these lend themselves to digitalization in the form of tablet applications (\emph{apps}). The role of the caregivers in this collaboration is to select which tools and methods to digitize and to help us do it by providing knowledge of the domain. They will also be the primary users of the resulting system, so they act as the \emph{external customers} in this collaboration. The role of the Software students in this collaboration is to understand their requirements and needs and develop the apps.

The overall system is called GIRAF (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk) and was initiated by Ulrik Nyman, Associate Professor at Aalborg University, in 2011. Since then, the \nth{6} semester students every year have been working on the project. The main purpose of the system, which is non-profit and open source, is assisting with planning and communication. Citizens with ASDs often have limited language skills and learn to enhance their communication with pictograms. This year, 51 students work on the project, distributed among fifteen project groups: Eleven groups of four students, one group of three, one group of two and two groups with only a single member each. It is crucial that project groups work together towards creating a working system, and to allow this, the semester coordinator recommended that the project should be agile and have four iterations. The organization of this report reflects this.

\section{Bootstrapping the Project}\todo{Jeg tror denne section passer bedre i sprint 1 (i know, men allerf√∏rst i sprint 1)}
While we do start the project with an existing code base, we need to define how we structure the work. We have an initial meeting where the apps are presented, and the status of the project is explained. We then start a discussion of how to organize the groups. We decide to use the SCRUM process for defining how work is prioritized and assigned. The process have evolved during the four iterations and the next chapter will describe the process as it was by the end of the last iteration.

\section{Report Organization}
\todo{Jeg er ikke glad for punktopstilling her}
\begin{documentorganization}
    \item in \chapterref{chap:sw_dev_method} we describe the software development method used across the multi-project as well as in our group. The method described is the final method which has been refined through each sprint;
    \item in \chapterref{chap:sw_intro_cm} we investigate what software configuration management means. Elaborating on this, we describe the organizational context and configuration items and tools.
    \item Sprint 1
    \item Sprint 2
    \item Sprint 3
    \item Sprint 4
    \item Evaluation of the project and recommendations for future developers. \todo{Add actual chapter references}

\todo{Find the good spot for this figure}
\kimnote{I love this figure. Consider placing it together in the section meeting dates and then add sprint end etc. You should also talk about the "holes" between sprint, where the GUI do sprint planning.}
Each sprint has approximately 8 full days per man.

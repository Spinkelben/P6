\chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of this semester project is to develop a complex software system in a large development environment. The software system is called GIRAF (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk) and is inherited from the 6\textsuperscript{th} semester students of past years.

The GIRAF project consists of several subprojects, that each serves a purpose of the combined system.

\section{Group Role in Multi-Project}
% Fra ulrik:
Ulrik recommends: A chapter describing the role of this project in the setting of the multi-project. This includes ``an analysis of an organizational context''

Not only should these subprojects be developed on, but the development process and other components should also be managed. Thus, many groups also have responsibilities to manage other parts than the actual code base. Here is a short description of these responsibilities:

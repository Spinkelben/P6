\chapter{Sprint Planning}
This sprint is the first where each subproject holds a separate sprint planning meeting. We describe only detail the \bd sprint planning. For the \db sprint planning we helped with the process since this was requested --- this is described too. The \gui sprint planning we only attended.

\section{\db Sprint Planning}
While we attended the first part of the \db sprint planning meeting as customers, we were asked to attend the second part as well, which is normally reserved for only the \db groups. We were asked since the initial part of the sprint planning meeting did no go so well --- too much time was spent discussing irrelevant things, since the product backlog was ``too close'' to external user needs, rather than internal user needs. In addition the \db POs were not entirely confident in running the later part of the meeting.

At the beginning of the second part of the meeting, we clarified how the remaining part was going to go. During the meeting we provided a few suggestions as to how to proceed. We did not influence the user stories they picked for their release backlog. Finally we gave them some feedback on the overall meeting. We concluded that it was mostly the backlog and the fact that the \db groups had not had such a meeting before that the meeting did not go smoothly.

\section{Sprint Goals}\label{sec:s2_goals}
\todo{Monkey test tog en del længere tid end estimeret.}

\todo{Vi droppede at kigge videre på at forbedre emulator speed fordi vi fokuserede på at fjerne build times på submodules. Der kom nogle nye tasks til, og vi reducerede derfor kraftigt tiden på de tasks der kiggede på emulatorforbedringer.}

\todo{Vi havde ikke nok tid til at skrive rapport for dette sprint. Vi brugte også noget tid på at færdiggøre rapport fra sidste sprint. Estimering på dette var en smule større end faktisk brugt, men passede ellers rimelig godt.}

\section{Multi-Project Sprint Review}\label{sec:s2_multiprj_review}
Again, a common meeting among all groups is held to evaluate and reflect upon the process in this sprint.

It was noticed that chickens during the meetings of this sprint had been too noisy at times. We pointed out that chickens should find alternative means of communicating during meetings, and hope this will be enough. Otherwise, we will point it out during meetings.

Also, some groups repeatedly did not show up to sprint meetings. We decided to find out the reasons behind it, knowing we cannot force them to show up. One group responded that they simply forgot the meetings, but will be more careful of remembering meetings in the future.

Two days between the \gui and the other two sprint planning meetings, suggested at the sprint 1 multi-project review, was implemented in this sprint. The feedback was positive and people were happy with this approach. As such we continue with it.

A suggestion was made allowing a product owner from \db and \bd to participate as pigs in the \gui sprint planning meeting. This seems like a good idea as they may have some useful input. We will add this to the development method.

It was suggested to add a feature freeze, but was quickly dismissed. Instead, we pleaded people to use common sense regarding implementing last minute changes before a sprint end. We also reminded people that they should talk to affected groups before making a change.

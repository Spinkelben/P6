\section{Sprint Goals}\label{sec:s3_goals}
\begin{description}
    \item[Make Guidelines for Continuous Integration (1)] We fulfill the developers desire for a clear central specification of the process. The specification is available on the Redmine Wiki, and resembles \chapterref{chap:sw_dev_method}. The specification is necessary as it is time consuming to explain it over and over, and because the process sometimes changes. A central wiki entry helps the developers keep up to date. It is to be seen if the developers actually start referring to the wiki, to settle uncertainties about the process, in their everyday work. 
    \item[Add a guide on how to do UI test (2)] We specify how to set up and run UI testing in a guide which is available on the Redmine Wiki. The guide links to the Android Developer website's testing guide \parencite{AndroidUnit}, as it is clear and comprehensive. Our guide just adds details specific to the multi-project, e.g.\ how to initialize the database with dummy data.

\section{Specification of Continuous Integration}
During sprint 2 we noticed only a few groups integrated their work into the master branch of each repository, resulting in little continuous integration. In addition groups expressed a desire to know when to release the various versions of their libraries to Artifactory. The user story specifying how to do continuous integration was prioritized highly by the groups in GUI and DB, and therefore we make this.

The CI guide has been released on Redmine, and is include in \appendixref{app:ci_guide}. Instructions on when to release to Artifactory has been added to the Redmine guide on dependencies. The instructions appears as specified in \sectionref{subsec:release-management}.

\section{Guide on Making Android UI Tests}
To create awareness of the opportunity for groups to have UI tests in the apps, we write a short guide on how to do this, as requested by the multi-project groups. This includes both running UI tests locally as well as in Jenkins upon each build. We do not want to spend much time on doing this, since a great amount of material is already available on the Internet. Therefore, we only find the appropriate material as well as comment on special considerations for our project. These special considerations include how to setup the database with dummy data, and faking login credentials.

The Android UI test guide can be seen in \appendixref{app:uitestguide}

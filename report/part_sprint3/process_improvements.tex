\section{Specification of Continuous Integration}
During sprint 2 we noticed only a few groups integrated their work into the master branch of each repository, resulting in little continuous integration. In addition groups expressed a desire to know when to release the various versions of their libraries to Artifactory. The user story specifying how to do continuous integration was prioritized highly by the groups in GUI and DB, and therefore we make this.

The CI guide has been released on Redmine, and is include in \appendixref{app:ci_guide}. Instructions on when to release to Artifactory has been added to the Redmine guide on dependencies. The instructions appears as specified in \sectionref{subsec:release-management}.

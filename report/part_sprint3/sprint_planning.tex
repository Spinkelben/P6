\chapter{Sprint Planning}\label{chap:s3_sprintplanning}
This sprint planning proceeded ordinarily as in Scrum of Scrums. We first had a sprint planning in the subproject followed by sprint planning in the group.

\begin{chapterorganization}
  \item in \sectionref{sec:S3_bd} we describe the result, i.e.\ the selected user stories, of the \bd sprint planning meeting.
  \item in \sectionref{sec:S3_group} we describe our own group sprint planning and lists our tasks with reference to a user story.
\end{chapterorganization}

\section{\bdtitle Sprint Planning}\label{sec:S3_bd}
At the \bd sprint planning we chose to work on the following user stories in this sprint. They are labeled with a number in parentheses for reference. Notice that due to unfinished business regarding sprint 2 in this report, we have not selected big user stories. This allows us to catch up on the report writing.

\begin{description}
  \item[Make Guidelines for Continuous Integration (1)] We found out that some groups have a long-term branch that they only merge into master at sprint ends. Investigating this, people from other groups mentioned that they are not sure of how to do continuous integration. Therefore we will make some guidelines.
  \item[Add a guide on how to do UI test (2)] Even though UI testing was implemented in sprint 1, no people from other groups were aware of the facility. We will make a small guide on this.
  \item[Monkey test (3)] There still were some problems from last sprint regarding sending extra information to apps, which we will remedy in this sprint.
  \item[Specify the Scrum process used (4)] Some groups have complained that the current documentation of the process used in the multi-project is too sparse. Therefore they have requested a detailed specification of the process.
\end{description}

\section{Group Sprint Planning}\label{sec:S3_group}
At our internal sprint planning we divided the chosen user stories into tasks and estimated those. For this sprint we have a total of 55 half days of work. \tableref{tab:sprint3_tasks} shows the tasks we have for this sprint. %Estimations in parentheses are the result of estimations being updated to due new priorities.
Tasks with a plus (+) are tasks that have been added during the sprint as they were discovered.

We made tasks for finishing the report of the previous sprint estimated for 25 half days. We estimate 11 half days for the report of this sprint. The original total amount of work estimated for both the report and user stories is 51. This leaves 4 units of unspecified work. When we made the tasks for this sprint, we were unsure about the amount of work contained in user story 4. Thus we made the task about investigating the Scrum process with \group{3}, which then resulted in the additional task \emph{Make process specification}.
During the sprint, we additionally added 8 half days of report tasks because we found more work. As such, we end up with a total of 59 half days, and completed them in 55.

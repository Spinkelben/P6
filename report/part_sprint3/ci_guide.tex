\chapter{Continuous Integration Guide}
We have commited ourselves to solve a user story proposed by the developers, which states that they want a guide about continuous integration. We observe that many developers \emph{want} continuous integration (it was a high priority user story in sprint 1), but do not really understand how to use it. In the sprints upto now, we have observed developers working on features on isolated branches for several weeks without integrating it with the master branch. Likewise, only a single group has written automated tests for their code. This is a big concern, because agile development and continuous integration highly depends on automated testing. In sprint 1, we wrote a sample test for each project to make it easy for developers to start writing tests. In sprint 2, we added a code coverage measure to each project. We find, however, that this has not resulted in more tests written. Therefore, it seems not be enough to simply write how to do. For this continuous integration guide, we try to argue more about why to do as we propose in order to convince developers that they should indeed follow the guidelines.

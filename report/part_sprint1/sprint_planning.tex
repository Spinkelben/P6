\chapter{Sprint Planning}
Write about how the first sprint planning went.

\section{User Stories Aggregation}
When the multi-project started there was no centralized product backlog, despite the fact that the previous year had used Scrum as well. As such all groups were at the start of the multi-project asked to read a report from the previous year and look for candidate user stories. These were aggregated in a Google Docs document. The user stories were categorized according to the subproject under which they related the most to.

When the first sprint planning was made, it was decided that each subproject would choose what user stories to put into the release backlog, based on the fact that the first sprint focused on bug fixing and making the applications work. There was, however, some confusion amongst the groups as to how to precede with filling in the product backlog and release backlog on Redmine. At a later meeting this was clarified and the product backlog and release backlog was filled into Redmine, by each subproject. In the build and deployment subproject this task was carried out by our group in collaboration with \group{5}.

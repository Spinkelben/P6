\chapter{Sprint Review}\label{chap:sprint1_end}
This sprint had a number of goals we wanted to achieve. During the sprint there were some development method changes that we investigated.

At the end of sprint 0 a several meetings were held, as described in \sectionref{sec:meetings}. This chapter described the meetings where we had a significant role.

Finally a review of the sprint was made together with all the groups of the multi-project.

\section{Process Evaluation During Sprint}
During sprint 0 two changes to the development method of the multi-project were made:

\begin{description}
  \item[Multiple Product Owners]
  \item[Office Hours] Initially when the semester started, it was decided that all groups must be in there group rooms from 09:00--15:00. However, some groups could not follow this requirement. This meant that some groups complained that they could not do their own work efficiently due to dependencies from the groups that were not present. Thus we were asked to take this up at the weekly meeting with the multi-project. There it was decided to relax the office hour requirement, such that it is acceptable to not be physically present in one's group room --- each group has to be contactable on email in the same time period.
\end{description}

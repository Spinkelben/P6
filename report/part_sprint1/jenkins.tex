\section{Automated Lint Check}
We have investigated the possibility of automating lint checks on the source code. There are some important considerations to consider before linting the source code automatically.

\todo{Write short paragraph on why lint is useful and wanted.}

The code base is inherited from earlier years and no lint checking was performed on this. Linting the code will produce a considerable amount of warnings. This is not desirable, as it will make the builds fail.

\todo{Write about how to diff lint results with baseline.}

\todo{Write about how to ignore the warnings found many times.}

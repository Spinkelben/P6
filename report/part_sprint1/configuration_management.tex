\section{Jenkins}\label{sec:jenkins}
Jenkins had been installed and setup by previous years. Jenkins is an open source tool for continuous integration. \todo{Write shortly about what Jenkins is and capable of}. The setup by previous years is rather basic and we have improved it in several ways.

\subsection{Upgrading Jenkins and Plugins}
We inherited the old installation which had not been updated in a long time. Jenkins itself and all the Jenkins plugins had updates available. We updated everything to the newest versions.

There are a number of unused plugins enabled in Jenkins. We tried to disable these, but this resulted in failure to start Jenkins. We undid the changes and have decided not to remove these unused plugins. \todo{Write why this is good enough.}

\subsection{Setting up Roles in Jenkins}
Before, everybody had full access.

\section{Build Automation}\label{sec:build_automation}
Vi har fikset det (noget med APK-filer) + skeduleret det nightly (nighly builds)

\subsection{Unit Testing}
\subsection{Integration Testing}
\subsection{UI Testing / Monkey Testing}
\subsection{Concolic Testing}
We don't want this.

\section{Automated Lint Check}\label{sec:automated_lint}
We have investigated the possibility of automating lint checks on the source code. There are some important considerations to consider before linting the source code automatically.

\todo{Write short paragraph on why lint is useful and wanted.}

The code base is inherited from earlier years and no lint checking was performed on this. Linting the code will produce a considerable amount of warnings. This is not desirable, as it will make the builds fail.

\todo{Write about how to diff lint results with baseline.}

\todo{Write about how to ignore the warnings found many times.}
